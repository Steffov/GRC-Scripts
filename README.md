# Gridly for Debian/ Ubuntu & Arch
Gridly is your personal Gridcoin wallet wizard and the replacement for the former grc script. 


### Update, install & download blocks script

__What do this script?__

Download, install or update newest Gridcoin wallet source code from git and compiles it automatically and easy. Gridly works for the qt wallet and for the daemon. The update part of the script proofs if the code at git is different to yours and starts only if it's necessary. The function download blocks makes a backup before the official snapshot will be downloaded and installed.



__Features__

- Installs all tools and programs are needed for compiling (build) the wallet on your machine. (approx. 400 MB free disc space needed! Without blockchain.)
- Only one file (script) needed for update, installation and download blocks.
- Download, copy & unzip the latest snapshot during installation and download blocks process. (For faster synchronization)
- Log file which is tracking the update changes. Saved in ```~/GridcoindResearch/gridlyb/grcs_vlogs.txt```.
- Creates ```gridcoinresearch.conf``` for the daemon and ask you all needed information during the installation process. **new**
- Creates menu entry with icon for qt wallet when required. Start your wallet with a click from your usual Linux menu. **new**
- Download blocks makes a backup of the current ```~/GridcoindResearch/``` content and saves it to ```~/GridcoindResearch/gridlyb/<date>```. Old ```gridcoinresearch.conf``` and ```wallet.dat``` will automaticly be pushed back to ```~/GridcoindResearch/```! No further action needed after download blocks. **new**
